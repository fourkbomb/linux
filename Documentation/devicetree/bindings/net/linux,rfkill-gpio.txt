Generic GPIO RF kill switch device tree binding

Required properties:
 - compatible: must be "linux,rfkill-gpio".
 - name: user-facing name of the kill switch.
 - type: type of the RF emitter controlled by this kill switch.
         Valid values are:
          "wlan" - 802.11 wireless network.
          "bluetooth" - Bluetooth.
          "ultrawideband" - Ultra wideband.
          "wimax" - WiMAX.
          "wwan" - Wireless WAN.
          "gps" - GPS.
          "fm" - FM radio.
          "nfc" - NFC.

At least one of the following properties must be specified:
 - reset-gpios: GPIO that, when asserted, will enable the RF emitter
 - shutdown-gpios: GPIO that, when asserted, will enable the RF emitter
Both of these GPIOs are controlled simultaneously by the driver.

Optional properties:
 - clocks: Clock that is enabled before unblocking and disabled after blocking.


Example:

rfkill-gpio {
        compatible = "linux,rfkill-gpio";
        name = "BCM4752";
        type = "gps";

        reset-gpios = <&gpx1 1 GPIO_ACTIVE_HIGH>;

        clocks = <&clock CLK_XUSBXTI>;
};
